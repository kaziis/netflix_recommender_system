# üçø Replicate Netflix's Movie Recommender System üçø 

## Project Overview
This was a semester-long project for a course at Baruch College. The professor for the course allowed students to form groups of four to build a movie recommender system similar to Netflix using Python. The two files that were provided for this project are found in the ``csv_files`` folder. The dataframes had to be merged and fixed to later be used for the machine learning model.

**Project Benefits**:
- Introduced to Python libaries.
  - ``pandas``
  - ``scikit-learn``
  - ``nltk``
- Perform data preprocessing and textual data mining.
- Create thresholds to improve recommendations.
- Develop a working algorithim that can predict similar movies.

## Summary
By the end of the project, the machine learning model allowed us to understand how valuable textual data can be. With the right data and tools, building an algorithim that can produce decent recommendations opened the eyes of many students in the class. It definitely motivated me to look for more opportunities in the space of machine learning and test around with other types of data.
